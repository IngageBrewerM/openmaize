# Contributing to Openmaize

The first part of this document covers the goals and the scope of Openmaize,
and then lists some ways that developers can contribute to it.

After that, there is more technical information about the contributing
process.

## Features

* checks for login / logout pages and handles these calls
* authenticates users using Json Web Tokens
* checks to see if the user is allowed to access the page / resource
* provides excellent documentation
* is framework-agnostic
* is lightweight

## Things we do not intend to implement

* email confirmation
* password reset

At the moment, we feel that these problems are best left outside the remit
of this library. However, if you can convince us that they are necessary,
we will be glad to implement them.

## Ways you can contribute

* Find bugs
* Help support more database adapters when making the Ecto query
* Add to, or improve, the documentation
* Add further plugs / checks you think might be useful
